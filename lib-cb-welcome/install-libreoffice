  INSTALL LibreOffice
  -------------------
  By default, CrunchBang comes preinstalled with some lightweight Office
  applications, AbiWord and Gnumeric. Would you like to install the more
  feature rich office suite, LibreOffice? If you choose to do this, the 
  following packages will be installed:

      libreoffice libreoffice-gtk

  Note: additional packages listed as dependencies may also be installed.

if [ "$a" != "s" ]; then
    echo ""
